▪ Introduction

Frontman is a striking Eurorack visual module (3U/22HP) built to help your music stand out on social media. Humans are naturally visual creatures—our brains process images faster than text, making compelling visuals crucial to catching attention. Frontman draws viewers in, increasing the likelihood they'll pause scrolling, explore your setup, and actually listen to your music.

▪ Specs

Frontman is powered by dual Raspberry Pi Pico 2 boards and features three circular 1.28-inch (240x240px) GC9A01 TFT LCD displays. With its integrated seven-band graphic equalizer (MSGEQ7) chip, Frontman dynamically translates your audio into vibrant, real-time visuals.

▪ Software

The directory "Flash_Files" contains the pre-compiled files for the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 - Just push the Pico's button, connect the USB and drag the .UF2 flash file to the relevant Eyes- and Mouth- controlling board.

▪ Software

For the more adventurous, feel free to download and unzip the full Pico SDK—then dive in and start rewriting the code from scratch.
