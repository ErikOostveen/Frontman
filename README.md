▪ Introduction

Frontman is a striking Eurorack visual module (3U/22HP) built to help your music stand out on social media. Humans are naturally visual creatures—our brains process images faster than text, making compelling visuals crucial to catching attention. Frontman draws viewers in, increasing the likelihood they'll pause scrolling, explore your setup, and actually listen to your music.
